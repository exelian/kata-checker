# kata-checker
A list of Kyokushinkai kata and additional software to verify correctness and style

# What is this
This is personal project to document and transscribe all karate kata I know from the style I practice: Kyokushinkai. The descriptions are mainly technical Japanse and some dutch clarifications.

Provided with the kata descriptions is a set of Notepad++ language definitions and a sort of linting to to verify consistency.
